# Advanced Sentinel: AI-Powered Missing Person Detection System

## Problem Statement
Traditional missing person searches are limited by manual processes, relying on static methods of identification and tracking. Law enforcement and search teams face significant challenges in:
- Efficiently tracking potential missing person sightings
- Processing large volumes of video surveillance data
- Quickly identifying and alerting relevant authorities
- Integrating advanced machine learning techniques in search efforts

## Watchman (Solution)
Watchman is a cutting-edge, AI-powered missing person detection system that revolutionizes the search and identification process. By leveraging state-of-the-art facial recognition, deep learning, and multi-camera monitoring, the system provides:

- Real-time missing person detection across multiple camera sources
- Advanced facial matching using deep learning techniques
- Automated alerting mechanisms for law enforcement
- Comprehensive logging and tracking of potential sightings

## Key Features
* **Multi-Technique Facial Recognition**
  - Combines traditional face encoding with deep learning feature extraction
  - High-precision matching with configurable confidence thresholds
  - Supports multiple camera sources and video streams

* **Advanced Machine Learning**
  - Utilizes ResNet50 for deep feature extraction
  - Adaptive matching algorithms with confidence scoring
  - Continuous learning and improvement capabilities

* **Comprehensive Alerting System**
  - Background thread for processing detection alerts
  - Configurable notification channels
  - Logging of all detection events

* **Flexible Configuration**
  - JSON-based configuration management
  - Customizable tolerance and alert thresholds
  - Easy integration with external law enforcement APIs

## System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for deep learning)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSARAWAGI05/Watchman.git
cd Watchman
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure MongoDB
